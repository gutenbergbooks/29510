<p>INTRODUCTION</p>

<p>It may seem wonderful that language, which is the only method of conveying
our conceptions, should, at the same time, be an hindrance to our advancement in
philosophy; but the wonder ceases when we consider, that it is seldom studied as
the vehicle of truth, but is too frequently esteemed for its own sake,
independent of its connection with things. This observation is remarkably
verified in the Greek language; which, as it is the only repository of ancient
wisdom, has, unfortunately for us, been the means of concealing, in shameful
obscurity, the most profound researches and the sublimest truths. That words,
indeed, are not otherwise valuable than as subservient to things, must surely be
acknowledged by every liberal mind, and will alone be disputed by him who has
spent the prime of his life, and consumed the vigour of his understanding, in
verbal criticisms and grammatical trifles. And, if this is the case, every lover
of truth will only study a language for the purpose of procuring the wisdom it
contains; and will doubtless wish to make his native language the vehicle of it
to others. For, since all truth is eternal, its nature can never be altered by
transposition, though by this means its dress may be varied, and become less
elegant and refined. Perhaps even this inconvenience may be remedied by sedulous
cultivation; at least, the particular inability of some, ought not to discourage
the well-meant endeavours of others. Whoever reads the lives of the ancient
Heroes of Philosophy, must be convinced that they studied things more than
words, and that Truth alone was the ultimate object of their search; and he who
wishes to emulate their glory and participate their wisdom, will study their
doctrines more than their language, and value the depth of their understandings
far beyond the elegance of their composition. The native charms of Truth will
ever be sufficient to allure the truly philosophic mind; and he who has once
discovered her retreats will surely endeavour to fix a mark by which they may be
detected by others.</p>

<p>But, though the mischief arising from the study of words is prodigious, we
must not consider it as the only cause of darkening the splendours of Truth, and
obstructing the free diffusion of her light. Different manners and philosophies
have equally contributed to banish the goddess from our realms, and to render
our eyes offended with her celestial light. Hence we must not wonder that, being
indignant at the change, and perceiving the empire of ignorance rising to
unbounded dominion, she has retired from the spreading darkness, and concealed
herself in the tranquil and divinely lucid regions of mind. For we need but
barely survey modern pursuits to be convinced how little they are connected with
wisdom. Since, to describe the nature of some particular place, the form,
situation and magnitude of a certain city; to trace the windings of a river to
its source, or delineate the aspect of a pleasant mountain; to calculate the
fineness of the silkworm's threads, and arrange the gaudy colours of
butterflies; in short, to pursue matter through its infinite divisions, and
wander in its dark labyrinths, is the employment of the philosophy in vogue. But
surely the energies of intellect are more worthy our concern than the operations
of sense; and the science of universals, permanent and fixed, must be superior
to the knowledge of particulars, fleeting and frail. Where is a sensible object
to be found, which abides for a moment the same; which is not either rising to
perfection, or verging to decay; which is not mixed and confused with its
contrary; whose flowing nature no resistance can stop, nor any art confine?
Where is the chemist who, by the most accurate analyzation can arrive at the
principles of bodies; or who, though he might be so lucky in his search as to
detect the atoms of Democritus, could by this means give respite to mental
investigation? For every atom, since endued with figure, must consist of parts,
though indissolubly cemented together; and the immediate cause of this cement
must be something incorporeal or knowledge can have no stability and enquiry no
end. Where, says Mr Harris, is the microscope which can discern what is smallest
in nature? Where the telescope which can see at what point in the universe
wisdom first began? Since, then, there is no portion of matter which may not be
the subject of experiments without end, let us betake ourselves to the regions
of mind, where all things are bounded in intellectual measure; where everything
is permanent and beautiful, eternal and divine. Let us quit the study of
particulars, for that which is general and comprehensive, and through this,
learn to see and recognize whatever exists.</p>

<p>With a view to this desirable end, I have presented the reader with a
specimen of that sublime wisdom which first arose in the colleges of the
Egyptian priests, and flourished afterwards in Greece; which was there
cultivated by Pythagoras, under the mysterious veil of numbers; by Plato, in the
graceful dress of poetry; and was systematized by Aristotle, as far as it could
be reduced into scientific order; which, after becoming in a manner extinct,
shone again with its pristine splendour among the philosophers of the
Alexandrian school; was learnedly illustrated with Asiatic luxuriancy of style
by Proclus; was divinely explained by Iamblichus: and profoundly delivered in
the writings of Plotinus. Indeed, the works of this last philosopher are
particularly valuable to all who desire to penetrate into the depths of this
divine wisdom. From the exalted nature of his genius, he was called Intellect by
his contemporaries, and is said to have composed his books under the influence
of divine illumination. Porphyry relates, in his life, that he was four times
united by an ineffable energy with the divinity; which, however such an account
may be ridiculed in the present age, will be credited by everyone who has
properly explored the profundity of his mind. The facility and vehemence of his
composition was such, that when he had once conceived a subject, he wrote as
from an internal pattern, without paying much attention to the orthography, or
reviewing what he had written; for the celestial vigour of his intellect
rendered him incapable of trifling concerns, and in this respect, inferior to
common understandings, as the eagle, which in its bold flight pierces the
clouds, skims the surface of the earth with less rapidity than the swallow.
Indeed a minute attention to trifles is inconsistent with great genius of every
kind, and it is on this account that retirement is so absolutely necessary to
the discovery of truths of the first dignity and importance; for how is it
possible to mix much with the world, without imbibing the false and puerile
conceptions of the multitude; and without losing that true elevation of soul
which comparatively despises every mortal concern? Plotinus, therefore,
conscious of the incorrectness of his writings arising from the rapidity,
exuberance and daring sublimity of his thoughts, committed their revision to his
disciple Porphyry; who, though inferior in depth of thought to his master, was,
on account of his extraordinary abilities, called by way of eminence the
Philosopher.</p>

<p>The design of the following discourse is to bring us to the perception of the
beautiful itself, even while connected with a corporeal nature, which must be
the great end of all true philosophy and which Plotinus happily obtained. To a
genius, indeed, truly modern, with whom the crucible and the air-pump are alone
the standards of Truth, such an attempt must appear ridiculous in the extreme.
With these, nothing is real but what the hand can grasp or the corporeal eye
perceives, and nothing useful but what pampers the appetite or fills the purse;
but unfortunately, their perceptions, like Homer's frail dreams, pass through
the ivory gate; and are consequently empty and fallacious, and contain nothing
belonging to the vigilant soul. To such as these a treatise on the beautiful
cannot be addressed; since its object is too exalted to be approached by those
engaged in the impurities of sense, and too bright to be seen by the eye
accustomed to the obscurity of corporeal vision. But it is alone proper to him
who is sensible that his soul is strongly marked with ruin by its union with
body; who considers himself in the language of Empedocles, as</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Heaven's exile, straying from the orb of light&quot;;</p>

<p>and who so ardently longs for a return to his true country, that to him, as
to Ulysses when fighting for Ithaca,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Slow seems the fun to move, the hours to roll;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His native home deep-imag'd in his soul&quot;.<a href=
"#note01"><u>[1]</u></a></p>

<p>But here it is requisite to observe that our ascent to this region of Beauty
must be made by gradual advances, for, from our association with matter, it is
impossible to pass directly, and without a medium, to such transcendent
perfection; but we must proceed in a manner similar to those who pass from
darkness to the brightest light, by advancing from places moderately
enlightened, to such as are the most luminous of all. It is necessary therefore,
that we should become very familiar with the most abstract contemplations; and
that our intellectual eye should be strongly irradiated with the light of ideas
which precedes the splendours of the beautiful itself, like the brightness which
is seen on the summit of mountains previous to the rising of the sun. Nor ought
it to seem strange, if it should be some time before even the liberal soul can
recognize the beautiful progeny of intellect as its kindred and allies; for,
from its union with body, it has drunk deep of the cup of oblivion, and all its
energetic powers are stupefied by the intoxicating draught; so that the
intelligible world, on its first appearance, is utterly unknown by us, and our
recollection of its inhabitants entirely lost; and we become familiar to Ulysses
on his first entrance into Ithaca, of whom Homer says,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Yet had his mind, thro' tedious absence lost<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dear remembrance of his native coast&quot;.<a href=
"#note02"><u>[2]</u></a></p>

<p>For,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now all the land another prospect bore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another port appeared, another shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And long-continued ways, and winding floods<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And unknown mountains crowned with unknown woods&quot;:</p>

<p>until the goddess of wisdom purges our eyes from the mists of sense and says
to each of us, as she did to Ulysses,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Now lift thy longing eyes, while I restore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pleasing prospect of thy native shore.&quot;</p>

<p>For then will</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; . . . . the prospect
clear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mists disperse, and all the coast appear.&quot;</p>

<p>Let us then, humbly supplicate the irradiations of wisdom, and follow
Plotinus as our divine guide to the beatific vision of the Beautiful itself; for
in this alone can we find perfect repose, and repair those destructive clefts
and chinks of the soul which its departure from the light of good, and its lapse
into a corporeal nature, have introduced.</p>

<p>But before I conclude, I think it necessary to caution the reader not to mix
any modern enthusiastic opinions with the doctrines contained in the following
discourse; for there is not a greater difference between substance and shade
than between ancient and modern enthusiasm. The object of the former was the
highest good and supreme beauty; but that of the latter is nothing more than a
phantom raised by bewildered imaginations, floating on the unstable ocean of
opinion, the sport of the waves of prejudice and blown about by the breath of
factious party. Like substance and shade, indeed they possess a similitude in
outward appearance, but in reality they are perfect contraries; for the one
fills the mind with solid and durable good, but the other with empty delusions;
which like the ever-running waters of the Danaides, glide away as fast as they
enter, and leave nothing behind but the ruinous passages through which they
flowed.</p>

<p>I only add, that the ensuing treatise is designed as a specimen (if it should
meet with encouragement) of my intended mode of publishing all the works of
Plotinus. The undertaking is, I am sensible, arduous in the extreme; and the
disciples of wisdom are unfortunately few; but, as I desire no other reward of
my labour, than to have the expense of printing defrayed, and to see Truth
propagated in my native tongue; I hope those few will enable me to obtain the
completion of my desires. For then, to adopt the words of Ulysses,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;That view vouchsaf'd, let instant death surprise<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With ever-during shade these happy eyes!&quot;<a href=
"#note03"><u>[3]</u></a></p><br>
<br>

<p>CONCERNING THE BEAUTIFUL</p>

<p>Beauty<a href="#note04"><u>[4]</u></a> for the most part, consists in objects
of sight; but it is also received through the ears, by the skilful composition
of words, and the consonant proportion of sounds; for in every species of
harmony, beauty is to be found. And if we rise from sense into the regions of
soul, we shall there perceive studies and offices, actions and habits, sciences
and virtues, invested with a much larger portion of beauty. But whether there is
above these, a still higher beauty, will appear as we advance in its
investigation. What is it then, which causes bodies to appear fair to the sight,
sounds beautiful to the ear, and science and virtue lovely to the mind? May we
not enquire after what manner they all partake of beauty? Whether beauty is one
and the same in all? Or, whether the beauty of bodies is of one kind, and the
beauty of souls of another? And again, what these are, if they are two? Or, what
beauty is, if perfectly simple, and one? For some things, as bodies, are
doubtless beautiful, not from the natures of the subjects in which they reside,
but rather by some kind of participation; but others again appear to be
essentially beautiful, or beauties themselves; and such is the nature of virtue.
For, with respect, to the same bodies, they appear beautiful to one person, and
the reverse of beauty to another; as if the essence of body were a thing
different from the essence of beauty. In the first place then, what is that,
which, by its presence, causes the beauty of bodies? Let us reflect, what most
powerfully attracts the eyes of beholders, and seizes the spectator with
rapturous delight; for if we can find what this is, we may perhaps use it as a
ladder, enabling us to ascend into the region of beauty, and survey its
immeasurable extent.</p>

<p>It is the general opinion that a certain commensuration of parts to each
other, and to the whole, with the addition, of colour, generates that beauty
which is the object of sight; and that in the commensurate and the moderate
alone the beauty of everything consists. But from such an opinion the compound
only, and not the simple, can be beautiful, the single parts will have no
peculiar beauty; and will only merit that appellation by conferring to the
beauty of the whole. But it is surely necessary that a lovely whole should
consist of beautiful parts, for the fair can never rise out of the deformed. But
from such a definition, it follows, that beautiful colours and the light of the
sun, since they are simple and do not receive their beauty from commensuration,
must be excluded the regions of beauty. Besides, how, from such an hypothesis
can gold be beautiful? Or the glittering of night and the glorious spectacle of
the stars? In like manner, the most simple musical sounds will be foreign from
beauty, though in a song wholly beautiful every note must be beautiful, as
necessary to the being of the whole. Again, since the same proportion remaining,
the same face is to one person beautiful and to another the reverse, is it not
necessary to call the beauty of the commensurate one kind of beauty and the
commensuration another kind, and that the commensurate is fair by means of
something else? But if transferring themselves to beautiful studies and fair
discourses, they shall assign as the cause of beauty in these the proportion of
measure, what is that which in beautiful sciences, laws or disciplines, is
called commensurate proportion? Or in what manner can speculations themselves be
called mutually commensurate? If it be said because of the inherent concord, we
reply that there is a certain concord and consent in evil souls, a conformity of
sentiment, in believing (as it is said) that temperance is folly and justice
generous ignorance. It appears, therefore, that the beauty of the soul is every
virtue, and this species of the beautiful possesses far greater reality than any
of the superior we have mentioned. But after what manner in this is
commensuration to be found? For it is neither like the symmetry in magnitude nor
in numbers. And since the parts of the soul are many, in what proportion and
synthesis, in what temperament of parts or concord of speculations, does beauty
consist? Lastly, of what kind is the beauty of intellect itself, abstracted from
every corporeal concern, and intimately conversing with itself alone?</p>

<p>We still, therefore, repeat the question, What is the beauty of bodies? It is
something which at first view presents itself to sense, and which the soul
familiarly apprehends and eagerly embraces, as if it were allied to itself. But
when it meets with the deformed, it hastily starts from the view and retires
abhorrent from its discordant nature. For since the soul in its proper state
ranks according to the most excellent essence in the order of things, when it
perceives any object related to itself, or the mere vestige of a relation, it
congratulates itself on the pleasing event, and astonished with the striking
resemblance<a href="#note05"><u>[5]</u></a> enters deep into its essence, and,
by rousing its dormant powers, at length perfectly recollects its kindred and
allies. What is the similitude then between the beauties of sense and that
beauty which is divine? For if there be any similitude the respective objects
must be similar. But after what manner are the two beautiful? For it is by
participation of species that we call every sensible object beautiful. Thus,
since everything void of form is by nature fitted for its reception, as far as
it is destitute of reason and form it is base and separate from the divine
reason, the great fountain of forms; and whatever is entirely remote from this
immortal source is perfectly base and deformed.<a href=
"#note06"><u>[6]</u></a> And such is matter, which by its nature is ever averse
from the supervening irradiations of form. Whenever, therefore, form accedes, it
conciliates in amicable unity the parts which are about to compose a whole; for
being itself one it is not wonderful that the subject of its power should tend
to unity, as far as the nature of a compound will admit. Hence beauty is
established in multitude when the many is reduced into one, and in this case it
communicates itself both to the parts and to the whole. But when a particular
one, composed from similar parts, is received it gives itself to the whole,
without departing from the sameness and integrity of its nature. Thus at one and
the same time it communicates itself to the whole building and its several
parts; and at another time confines itself to a single stone, and then the first
participation arises from the operations of art, but the second from the
formation of nature. And hence body becomes beautiful through the communion
supernally proceeding from divinity.</p>

<p>But the soul, by her innate power, than which nothing more powerful, in
judging its proper concerns, when another soul concurs in the decision,
acknowledges the beauty of forms. And, perhaps, its knowledge in this case
arises from its accommodating its internal ray of beauty to form, and trusting
to this in its judgment; in the same manner as a rule is employed in the
decision of what is straight. But how can that which is inherent in body, accord
with that which is above body? Let us reply by asking how the architect
pronounces the building beautiful by accommodating the external structure the
fabric of his soul? Perhaps, because the outward building, when entirely
deprived of the stones, is no other than the intrinsic form, divided by the
external mass of matter, but indivisibly existing, though appearing in the many.
When, therefore, sense beholds the form in bodies, at strife with matter,
binding and vanquishing its contrary nature, and sees form gracefully shining
forth in other forms, it collects together the scattered whole, and introduces
it to itself, and to the indivisible form within; and renders it consonant,
congruous and friendly to its own intimate form. Thus, to the good man, virtue
shining forth in youth is lovely because consonant to the true virtue which lies
deep in the soul. But the simple beauty of colour arises, when light, which is
something incorporeal, and reason and form entering the obscure involutions of
matter, irradiates and forms its dark and formless nature. It is on this account
that fire surpasses other bodies in beauty, because, compared with the other
elements, it obtains the order of form; for it is more eminent than the rest,
and is the most subtle of all, bordering, as it were, on an incorporeal nature.
And too, that though impervious itself it is intimately received by others, for
it imparts heat, but admits no cold. Hence it is the first nature which is
ornamented with colour, and is the source of it to others; and on this account
it beams forth exalted like some immaterial form. But when it cannot vanquish
its subject, as participating but a slender light, it is no longer beautiful,
because it does not receive the whole form of colour. Again, the music of the
voice rouses the harmony latent in the soul, and opens her eye to the perception
of beauty, existing in many the same. But it is the property of the harmony
perceived by sense, to be measured by numbers, yet not in every proportion of
number or voice; but in that alone which is obedient to the production, and
conquest of its species. And this much for the beauties of sense, which, like
images and shadows flowing into matter, adorn with spectacles of beauty its
formless being, and strike the respective senses with wonder and delight.</p>

<p>But it is now time, leaving every object of sense far behind, to contemplate,
by a certain ascent, a beauty of a much higher order; a beauty not visible to
the corporeal eye, but alone manifest to the brighter eye of the soul,
independent of all corporeal aid. However, since, without some previous
perception of beauty it is impossible to express by words the beauties of sense,
but we must remain in the state of the blind, so neither can we ever speak of
the beauty of offices and sciences, and whatever is allied to these, if deprived
of their intimate possession. Thus we shall never be able to tell of virtue's
brightness, unless by looking inward we perceive the fair countenance of justice
and temperance, and are convinced that neither the evening nor morning star are
half so beautiful and bright. But it is requisite to perceive objects of this
kind by that eye by which the soul beholds such real beauties. Besides it is
necessary that whoever perceives this species of beauty, should be seized with
much greater delight, and more vehement admiration, than any corporeal beauty
can excite; as now embracing beauty real and substantial. Such affections, I
say, ought to be excited about true beauty, as admiration and sweet
astonishment; desire also and love and a pleasant trepidation. For all souls, as
I may say, are affected in this manner about invisible objects, but those the
most who have the strongest propensity to their love; as it likewise happens
about corporeal beauty; for all equally perceive beautiful corporeal forms, yet
all are not equally excited, but lovers in the greatest degree.</p>

<p>But it may be allowable to interrogate those, who rise above sense,
concerning the effects of love in this manner; of such we enquire, what do you
suffer respecting fair studies, and beautiful manners, virtuous works,
affections, and habits, and the beauty of souls? What do you experience on
perceiving yourselves lovely within? After what manner are you roused as it were
to a Bacchalian fury; striving to converse with yourselves, and collecting
yourselves separate from the impediments of body? For thus are true lovers
enraptured. But what is the cause of these wonderful effects. It is neither
figure, nor colour, nor magnitude; but soul herself, fair through temperance,
and not with the false gloss of colour, and bright with the splendours of virtue
herself. And this you experience as often as you turn your eye inwards; or
contemplate the amplitude of another soul; the just manners, the pure
temperance; fortitude venerable by her noble countenance; and modesty and
honesty walking with an intrepid step, and a tranquil and steady aspect; and
what crowns the beauty of them all, constantly receiving the irradiations of a
divine intellect.</p>

<p>In what respect then, shall we call these beautiful? For they are such as
they appear, nor did ever anyone behold them, and not pronounce them realities.
But as yet reason desires to know how they cause the loveliness of the soul; and
what that grace is in every virtue which beams forth to view like light? Are you
then willing we should assume the contrary part, and consider what in the soul
appears deformed? for perhaps it will facilitate our search, if we can thus find
what is base in the soul, and from whence it derives its original.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a soul deformed, to be one intemperate and unjust, filled with
a multitude of desires, a prey to foolish hopes and vexed with idle fears;
through its diminutive and avaricious nature the subject of envy; employed
solely in thought of what is immoral and low, bound in the fetters of impure
delights, living the life, whatever it may be, peculiar to the passion of body;
and so totally merged in sensuality as to esteem the base pleasant, and the
deformed beautiful and fair. But may we not say, that this baseness approaches
the soul as an adventitious evil, under the pretext of adventitious beauty;
which, with great detriment, renders it impure, and pollutes it with much
depravity; so that it neither possesses true life, nor true sense, but is endued
with a slender life through its mixture of evil, and this worn out by the
continual depredations of death; no longer perceiving the objects of mental
vision, nor permitted any more to dwell with itself, because ever hurried away
to things obscure, external and low? Hence, becoming impure, and being on all
sides snatched in the unceasing whirl of sensible forms, it is covered with
corporeal stains, and wholly given to matter, contracts deeply its nature, loses
all its original splendour, and almost changes its own species into that of
another; just as the pristine beauty of the most lovely form would be destroyed
by its total immersion in mire and clay. But the deformity of the first arises
from inward filth, of its own contracting; of the second, from the accession of
some foreign nature. If such a one then desires to recover his former beauty, it
is necessary to cleanse the infected parts, and thus by a thorough purgation to
resume his original form. Hence, then if we assert that the soul, by her
mixture, confusion and commerce with body and matter, becomes thus base, our
assertion will, I think, be right. For the baseness of the soul consists in not
being pure and sincere. And as the gold is deformed by the adherence of earthly
clods, which are no sooner removed than on a sudden the gold shines forth with
its native purity; and then becomes beautiful when separated from natures
foreign from its own, and when it is content with its own purity for the
possession of beauty; so the soul, when separated from the sordid desires
engendered by its too great immersion in body, and liberated from the dominion
of every perturbation, can thus and thus only, blot out the base stains imbibed
from its union with body; and thus becoming alone, will doubtless expel all the
turpitude contracted from a nature so opposite to its own.</p>

<p>Indeed, as the ancient oracle declares, temperance and fortitude, prudence
and every virtue, are certain purgatives of the soul; and hence the sacred
mysteries prophesy obscurely, yet with truth, that the soul not purified lies in
Tartarus, immersed in filth. Since the impure is, from his depravity, the friend
of filth, as swine, from their sordid body, delight in mire alone.</p>

<p>For what else is true temperance than not to indulge in corporeal delights,
but to fly from their connection, as things which are neither pure, nor the
offspring of purity? And true fortitude is not to fear death; for death is
nothing more than a certain separation of soul from body, and this he will not
fear, who desires to be alone. Again, magnanimity is the contempt of every
mortal concern; it is the wing by which we fly into the regions of intellect.
And lastly, prudence is no other than intelligence, declining subordinate
objects; and directing the eye of the soul to that which is immortal and divine.
The soul, thus defined, becomes form and reason, is altogether incorporeal and
intellectual, and wholly participates of that divine nature, which is the
fountain of loveliness, and of whatever is allied to the beautiful and fair.
Hence the soul reduced to intellect becomes astonishingly beautiful; for as the
lambent flame which appears detached from the burning wood, enlightens its dark
and smoky parts, so intellect irradiates and adorns the inferior powers of the
soul, which, without its aid, would be buried in the gloom of formless matter.
But intellect, and whatever emanates from intellect, is not the foreign, but the
proper ornament of the soul, for the being of the soul, when absorbed in
intellect, is then alone real and true. It is, therefore, rightly said, that the
beauty and good of the soul consists in her similitude to the Deity<i>;</i> for
from hence flows all her beauty, and her allotment of a better being. But the
beautiful itself is that which is called beings; and turpitude is of a different
nature and participates more of non-entity than being.</p>

<p>But, perhaps, the good and the beautiful are the same, and must be
investigated by one and the same process; and in like manner the base and the
evil. And in the first rank we must place the beautiful, and consider it as the
same with the good; from which immediately emanates intellect as beautiful. Next
to this, we must consider the soul receiving its beauty from intellect, and
every inferior beauty deriving its origin from the forming power of the soul,
whether conversant in fair actions and offices, or sciences and arts. Lastly,
bodies themselves participate of beauty from the soul, which, as something
divine, and a portion of the beautiful itself, renders whatever it supervenes
and subdues, beautiful as far as its natural capacity will admit.</p>

<p>Let us, therefore, re-ascend to the good itself, which every soul desires;
and in which it can alone find perfect repose. For if anyone shall become
acquainted with this source of beauty he will then know what I say, and after
what manner he is beautiful. Indeed, whatever is desirable is a kind of good,
since to this desire tends. But they alone pursue true good, who rise to
intelligible beauty, and so far only tend to good itself; as far as they lay
aside the deformed vestments of matter, with which they become connected in
their descent. Just as those who penetrate into the holy retreats of sacred
mysteries, are first purified and then divest themselves of their garments,
until someone by such a process, having dismissed everything foreign from the
God, by himself alone, beholds the solitary principle of the universe, sincere,
simple and pure, from which all things depend, and to whose transcendent
perfections the eyes of all intelligent natures are directed, as the proper
cause of being, life and intelligence. With what ardent love, with what strong
desire will he who enjoys this transporting vision be inflamed while vehemently
affecting to become one with this supreme beauty! For this it is ordained, that
he who does not yet perceive him, yet desires him as good, but he who enjoys the
vision is enraptured with his beauty, and is equally filled with admiration and
delight. Hence, such a one is agitated with a salutary astonishment; is affected
with the highest and truest love; derides vehement affections and inferior
loves, and despises the beauty which he once approved. Such, too, is the
condition of those who, on perceiving the forms of gods or daemons, no longer
esteem the fairest of corporeal forms. What, then, must be the condition of that
being, who beholds the beautiful itself?</p>

<p>In itself perfectly pure<a href="#note07"><u>[7]</u></a>, not confined by any
corporeal bond, neither existing in the heavens, nor in the earth, nor to be
imaged by the most lovely form imagination can conceive; since these are all
adventitious and mixed, and mere secondary beauties, proceeding from the
beautiful itself. If, then, anyone should ever behold that which is the source
of munificence to others, remaining in itself, while it communicates to all, and
receiving nothing, because possessing an inexhaustible fulness; and should so
abide in the intuition, as to become similar to his nature, what more of beauty
can such a one desire? For such beauty, since it is supreme in dignity and
excellence, cannot fail of rendering its votaries lovely and fair. Add too, that
since the object of contest to souls is the highest beauty, we should strive for
its acquisition with unabated ardour, lest we should be deserted of that
blissful contemplation, which, whoever pursues in the right way, becomes blessed
from the happy vision; and which he who does not obtain is unavoidably unhappy.
For the miserable man is not he who neglects to pursue fair colours, and
beautiful corporeal forms; who is deprived of power, and falls from dominion and
empire but he alone who is destitute of this divine possession, for which the
ample dominion of the earth and sea and the still more extended empire of the
heavens, must be relinquished and forgot, if, despising and leaving these far
behind, we ever intend to arrive at substantial felicity, by beholding the
beautiful itself.</p>

<p>What measures, then, shall we adopt? What machine employ, or what reason
consult by means of which we may contemplate this ineffable beauty; a beauty
abiding in the most divine sanctuary without ever proceeding from its sacred
retreats lest it should be beheld by the profane and vulgar eye? We must enter
deep into ourselves, and, leaving behind the objects of corporeal sight, no
longer look back after any of the accustomed spectacles of sense. For, it is
necessary that whoever beholds this beauty, should withdraw his view from the
fairest corporeal forms; and, convinced that these are nothing more than images,
vestiges and shadows of beauty, should eagerly soar to the fair original from
which they are derived. For he who rushes to these lower beauties, as if
grasping realities, when they are only like beautiful images appearing in water,
will, doubtless, like him in the fable, by stretching after the shadow, sink
into the lake and disappear. For, by thus embracing and adhering to corporeal
forms, he is precipitated, not so much in his body as in his soul, into profound
and horrid darkness; and thus blind, like those in the infernal regions,
converses only with phantoms, deprived of the perception of what is real and
true. It is here, then, we may more truly exclaim, &quot;Let us depart from hence,
and fly to our father's delightful land&quot;.<a href=
"#note08"><u>[8]</u></a> But, by what leading stars shall we direct our flight,
and by what means avoid the magic power of Circe, and the detaining charms of
Calypso?<a href=
"#note09"><u>[9]</u></a> For thus the fable of Ulysses obscurely signifies,
which feigns him abiding an unwilling exile, though pleasant spectacles were
continually presented to his sight; and everything was promised to invite his
stay which can delight the senses, and captivate the heart. But our true
country, like that of Ulysses, is from whence we came, and where our father
lives. But where is the ship to be found by which we can accomplish our flight?
For our feet are unequal to the task since they only take us from one part of
the earth to another. May we not each of us say,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;What ships have I, what sailors to convey,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What oars to cut the long laborious way&quot;.<a href=
"#note10"><u>[10]</u></a></p>

<p>But it is in vain that we prepare horses to draw our ships to transport us to
our native land. On the contrary, neglecting all these, as unequal to the task,
and excluding them entirely from our view, having now closed the corporeal eye,<a href=
"#note11"><u>[11]</u></a> we must stir up and assume a purer eye within, which
all men possess, but which is alone used by a few. What is it, then, this inward
eye beholds? Indeed, suddenly raised to intellectual vision, it cannot perceive
an object exceeding bright. The soul must therefore be first accustomed to
contemplate fair studies and then beautiful works, not such as arise from the
operations of art, but such as are the offspring of worthy men; and next to this
it is necessary to view the soul, which is the parent of this lovely race. But
you will ask, after what manner is this beauty of a worthy soul to be perceived?
It is thus. Recall your thoughts inward, and if while contemplating yourself,
you do not perceive yourself beautiful, imitate the statuary; who when he
desires a beautiful statue cuts away what is superfluous, smooths and polishes
what is rough, and never desists until he has given it all the beauty his art is
able to effect. In this manner must you proceed, by lopping what is luxuriant,
directing what is oblique, and, by purgation, illustrating what is obscure, and
thus continue to polish and beautify your statue until the divine splendour of
Virtue shines upon you, and Temperance seated in pure and holy majesty rises to
your view. If you become thus purified residing in yourself, and having nothing
any longer to impede this unity of mind, and no farther mixture to be found
within, but perceiving your whole self to be a true light, and light alone; a
light which though immense is not measured by any magnitude, nor limited by any
circumscribing figure, but is everywhere immeasurable, as being greater than
every measure, and more excellent than every quantity; if, perceiving yourself
thus improved, and trusting solely to yourself, as no longer requiring a guide,
fix now steadfastly your mental view, for with the intellectual eye alone can
such immense beauty be perceived. But if your eye is yet infected with any
sordid concern, and not thoroughly refined, while it is on the stretch to behold
this most shining spectacle, it will be immediately darkened and incapable of
intuition, though someone should declare the spectacle present, which it might
be otherwise able to discern. For, it is here necessary that the perceiver and
the thing perceived should be similar to each other before true vision can
exist. Thus the sensitive eye can never be able to survey, the orb of the sun,
unless strongly endued with solar fire, and participating largely off the vivid
ray. Everyone therefore must become divine, and of godlike beauty, before he can
gaze upon a god and the beautiful itself. Thus proceeding in the right way of
beauty he will first ascend into the region of intellect, contemplating every
fair species, the beauty of which he will perceive to be no other than ideas
themselves; for all things are beautiful by the supervening irradiations of
these, because they are the offspring and essence of intellect. But that which
is superior to these is no other than the fountain of good, everywhere widely
diffusing around the streams of beauty, and hence in discourse called the
beautiful itself because beauty is its immediate offspring. But if you
accurately distinguish the intelligible objects you will call the beautiful the
receptacle of ideas; but the good itself, which is superior, the fountain and
principle of the beautiful; or, you may place the first beautiful and the good
in the same principle, independent of the beauty which there subsists.<a href="#note12"><u>[12]</u></a></p><br>

<p><a name="note04" id="note04"><u>4</u>&nbsp;</a> It is necessary to inform the
Platonical reader, that the Beautiful, in the present discourse, is considered
according to its most general acceptation, as the same with the Good: though,
according to a more accurate distinction, as Plotinus himself informs us, the
Good is considered as the fountain and principle of the Beautiful. I think it
likewise proper to observe, that as I have endeavoured, by my paraphrase, to
render as much as possible the obscure parts evident, and to expand those
sentences which are so very much contracted in the original, I shall be sparing
of notes; for my design is not to accommodate the sublimest truths to the
meanest understandings (as this would be a contemptible and useless
prostitution), but to render them perspicuous to truly liberal and philosophic
minds. My reasons for adopting this mode of paraphrase, may be seen in the
preface to my translation of
<i>Orpheus's Hymns.</i></p>

<p><a name="note05" id="note05"><u>5</u>&nbsp;</a> &quot;Enters deep into its essence,&quot;
etc. The Platonic Philosophy insists much on the necessity of retiring into
ourselves in order to the discovery of truth; and on this account Socrates, in
the first <i>Alcibiades,</i>
says that the soul entering into herself will contemplate whatever exists and
the divinity himself. Upon which Proclus thus comments, with his usual elegance
and depth (in
<i>Theol. Plat,</i> p. 7): &quot;For the soul,&quot; says he, &quot;contracting herself wholly
into a union with herself, and into the centre of universal life, and removing
the multitude and variety of all-various powers, ascends into the highest place
of speculation, from whence she will survey the nature of beings. For if she
looks back upon things posterior to her essence, she will perceive nothing but
the shadows and resemblances of beings; but if she returns into herself she will
evolve her own essence, and the reasons she contains. And at first indeed she
will, as it were, only behold herself; but when by her knowledge she penetrates
more profoundly in her investigations she will find intellect seated in her
essence and the universal orders of beings; but when she advances into the more
interior recesses of herself, and as it were into the sanctuary of the soul, she
will be enabled to contemplate, with her eyes closed to corporeal vision, the
genus of the gods and the unities of beings. For all things reside in us, after
a manner correspondent to the nature of the soul; and on this account we are
naturally enabled to know all things, by exciting our inherent powers and images
of whatever exists.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="note06" id="note06"><u>6</u>&nbsp;</a> &quot;And such is matter,&quot; etc. There
is nothing affords more wonderful speculation than matter, which ranks as the
last among the universality of things, and has the same relation to being as
shade to substance. For, as in an ascending series of causes it is necessary to
arrive at something, which is the first cause of all, and to which no perfection
is wanting; so in a descending series of subjects, it is equally necessary we
should stop at some general subject, the lowest in the order of things, and to
which every perfection of being is denied. But let us hear the profound and
admirable description which Plotinus gives us of matter (lib. vi., Ennead 3),
and of which the following is a paraphrase: &quot;Since matter,&quot; says he, &quot;is neither
soul, nor intellect, nor life, nor form, nor reason, nor bound, but a certain
indefiniteness; nor yet capacity, for what can it produce? Since it is foreign
from all these, it cannot merit the appellation of being, but is deservedly
called non-entity. Nor yet is it non-entity in the manner as motion or station;
but it is true non-entity, the mere shadow and imagination of bulk and the
desire of subsistence; abiding without station, of itself invisible, and
avoiding the desire of him who wishes to perceive its nature. Hence, when no one
perceives it, it is then in a manner present, but cannot be viewed by him who
strives intently to behold it. Again, in itself contraries always appear, the
small and the great, the less and the more, deficience and excess. So that it is
a phantom, neither abiding nor yet able to fly away; capable of no one
denomination and possessing no power from intellect, but constituted in the
defect and shade, as it were, of all real being. Hence, too, in each of its
vanishing appellations it eludes our search; for if we think of it as something
great, it is in the meantime small; if as something more, it becomes less; and
the apparent being which we meet with in its image is non-being, and as it were
a flying mockery. So that the forms which appear in matter are merely ludicrous,
shadows falling upon shadow, as in a mirror, where the position of a thing is
different from its real situation; and which, though apparently full of forms,
possesses nothing real and true--but imitations of being and semblances flowing
about a formless semblance. They appear, indeed, to affect something in the
subject matter, but in reality produce nothing; from their debile and flowing
nature being endued with no solidity and no rebounding power. And since matter,
likewise, has no solidity they penetrate it without division, like images in
water, or as if anyone should fill a vacuum with forms.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="note07" id="note07"><u>7</u>&nbsp;</a> &quot;In itself perfectly pure.&quot; This
is analogous to the description of the beautiful in the latter part of Diotima's
Speech in the <i>Banquet</i>; a speech which is surely unequalled, both for
elegance of composition and sublimity of sentiment. Indeed, all the disciples of
Plato are remarkable for nothing so much as their profound and exalted
conceptions of the Deity; and he who can read the works of Plotinus and Proclus
in particular, and afterwards pity the weakness and erroneousness of their
opinions on this subject, may be fairly presumed to be himself equally an object
of pity and contempt.</p>

<p><a name="note08" id="note08"><u>8</u>&nbsp;</a> &quot;Let us depart,&quot; etc., <i>vide</i>
Hom., <i>Iliad,</i> lib. ii., 140, et lib. ix., 27.</p>

<p><a name="note09" id="note09"><u>9</u>&nbsp;</a> Porphyry informs us in his
excellent treatise, <i>De Antro Nymph,</i> that it was the opinion of Numenius,
the Pythagorean (to which he also assents), that the person of Ulysses in the <i>
Odyssey,</i> represents to us a man, who passes in a regular manner, over the
dark and stormy sea of generation; and thus, at length, arrives at that region
where tempests and seas are unknown, and finds a nation who</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Ne'er knew salt, or heard the billows roar.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, he who is conscious of the delusions of the present life and the
enchantments of this material house, in which his soul is detained like Ulysses
in the irriguous cavern of Calypso, will like him continually bewail his
captivity, and inly pine for a return to his native country. Of such a one it
may be said as of Ulysses (in the excellent and pathetic translation of Mr
Pope):</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;But sad Ulysses by himself apart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour'd the big sorrows of his swelling heart,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All on the lonely shore he sate to weep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And roll'd his eyes around the restless deep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tow'rd the lov'd coast he roll'd his eyes in vain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till, dimmed with rising grief, they stream'd again.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Odyssey,</i> book v.,
103.</p>

<p>Such a one too, like Ulysses, will not always wish in vain for a passage over
the dark ocean of a corporeal life, but by the assistance of Mercury, who may be
considered as the emblem of reason, he will at length be enabled to quit the
magic embraces of Calypso, the Goddess of Imagination, and to return again into
the arms of Penelope, or Philosophy, the long lost and proper object of his
love.</p>

<p><a name="note10" id="note10"><u>10</u>&nbsp;</a> See Pope's Homer's <i>Odyssey,</i>
book v., 182.</p>

<p><a name="note11" id="note11"><u>11</u>&nbsp;</a> &quot;We must stir up and assume a
purer eye within.&quot; This inward eye is no other than intellect, which contains in
its most inward recesses a certain ray of light, participated from the sun of
Beauty and Good, by which the soul is enabled to behold and become united with
her divinely solitary original. This divine ray, or, as Proclus calls it, mark
or impression, is thus beautifully described by that philosopher <i>(Theol.
Plat,</i> p. 105): &quot;The Author of the Universe,&quot; says he, &quot;has planted in all
beings impressions of his own perfect excellence, and through these he has
placed all beings about himself, and is present with them in an ineffable
manner, exempt from the universality of things. Hence, every being entering into
the ineffable sanctuary of its own nature finds there a symbol of the Father of
all. And by this mystical impression which corresponds to his nature they become
united with their original, divesting themselves of their own essence and
hastening to become his impression alone; and, through a desire of his unknown
nature and of the fountain of good, to participate in him alone. And when they
have ascended as far as to this cause they enjoy perfect tranquillity and are
conversant in the perception of his divine progeny and of the love which all
things naturally possess, and goodness, unknown, ineffable, without
participation and transcendently full.&quot;</p>

<p><a name="note12" id="note12"><u>12</u>&nbsp;</a> But before I take my leave of
Plotinus, I cannot refrain from addressing a few words to the Platonical part of
my readers. If such then is the wisdom contained in the works of this
philosopher, as we may conclude from the present specimen, is it fit so divine a
treasure should be concealed in shameful oblivion? With respect to true
philosophy you must be sensible that all modern sects are in a state of
barbarous ignorance; for Materialism and its attendant Sensuality have darkened
the eyes of the <i>many</i> with the mists of error, and are continually
strengthening their corporeal tie. And can anything more effectually dissipate
this increasing gloom than discourses composed by so sublime a genius, pregnant
with the most profound conceptions, and everywhere full of intellectual light?
Can anything so thoroughly destroy the phantom of false enthusiasm as
establishing the real object of the true? Let us then boldly enlist ourselves
under the banners of Plotinus, and, by his assistance, vigorously repel the
encroachments of error, plunge her dominions into the abyss of forgetfulness,
and disperse the darkness of her baneful night. For indeed there never was a
period which required so much philosophic exertion, or such vehement contention
from the lovers of Truth. On all sides nothing of philosophy remains but the
name, and this is become the subject of the vilest prostitution; since it is not
only engrossed by the naturalist, chemist, and anatomist, but is usurped by the
mechanic in every trifling invention, and made subservient to the lucre of
traffic and merchandise. There cannot surely be a greater proof of the
degeneracy of the times than so unparalleled a degradation and so barbarous a
perversion of terms. For the word philosophy, which implies the love of wisdom,
is now become the ornament of folly. In the times of its inventor, and for many
succeeding ages, it was expressive of modesty and worth; in our days it is the
badge of impudence and vain pretensions. It was formerly the symbol of the
profound contemplative genius, it is now the mark of the superficial and
unthinking practitioner. It was once reverenced by kings and clothed in the
robes of nobility; it is now (according to its true acceptation) abandoned and
despised and ridiculed by the vilest plebeian. Permit me, then, my friends, to
address you in the words of Achilles to Hector:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;Rouse, then, your forces this important hour,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Collect your strength and call forth all your pow'r.&quot;</p>

<p>Since, to adopt the animated language of Neptune to the Greeks,</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot; . . . On dastards,
dead to fame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waste no anger, for they feel no shame,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But you, the pride, the flower of all our host,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart weeps blood, to see your glory lost.&quot;</p>

<p>Nor deem the exhortation impertinent, and the danger groundless:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;For lo! the fated time, th' appointed shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hark, the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar.&quot;</p>

<p>Impetuous ignorance is thundering at the bulwarks of philosophy and her
sacred retreats are in danger of being demolished, through our feeble
resistance. Rise then, my friends, and the victory will be ours. The foe is
indeed numerous, but at the same time feeble; and the weapons of truth in the
hands of vigorous union, descend with irresistible force, and are fatal wherever
they fall.</p>---<br>
